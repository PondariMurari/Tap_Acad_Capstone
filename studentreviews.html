        <p>S.V.C.E college</p>
        <p>Hello, I am Manipatruni Asish Patnaik 
            and I em a fresher from ECE background. 
            I have been enrolled in tap academy since 
            may 2021 in full stack java development Course
            This course has really helped me to achieve
            knowledge in java and other laguages like Html,
            Css and JavaScript. The augmented reality used
            by TapAcademy helped me a lot in a detailed manner from the memory point of view. 
            So from my point of view if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy,
            I will definitely suggest for this course because it's worthy</p>

        <p>R. K. S. D college</p>
        <p>Getting Enrolled in tap academy is one my best
            decision. Clear understanding of basics from Ims,
            consistent practice with live class, daily signment 
            gives boost,24 hrs doubt solving assistance from mentor,
            mock test every Friday and Saturday helps in self evaluation. 
            For me till now it's been a great journey and daily I am learning
            something new and improving myself. I have no more fear of not
            getting a job because after 2 months with tap academy I am getting various offers.</p>

        <p>Tap-Academy is the best e-learning platform. 
            The concepts are taught very clearly and 
            if we are faced with any doubts they make 
            sure that,they clear the doubts.

            which makes it is easier to grasp and understand 
            the concepts clearly. Friendly environment and 
            the mentors are easy to communicate.</p>
